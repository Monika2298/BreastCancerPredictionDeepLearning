# BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING 

GOAL OF THE PROJECT-
To predict breast cancer for multiple patients simultaneously to save time so that necessary actions can be taken as earlier as possible. 
The system predicts breast cancer with the accuracy of 99.3 percent. Along with prediction the system also displays the severity of cancer through Probability feature

DATASET USED- Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.(Available in various repositories- KAGGLE , UCI repository etc.)

MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS USED
The highest accuracy obtained in case of machine learning algorithms were given by RANDOM FOREST and SVM i.e. 96.5 percent
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. Decision Tree
4. Naive Bayes Classifier
5. Random Forest

DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS USED
The highest accuracy was obtained by ANN i.e. 99.3 percent
1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

USER INTERFACE-
Created using FLASK which is a python web framework to interact with the system. The model ANN which gave the highest accuracy runs in background and gives the prediction.

##NOTE- While creating project it is preferred to install all required libraries in your computer so that user interface can be created easily.
